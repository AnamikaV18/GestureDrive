🏎️ GestureDrive: Real-Time Hand Gesture Controller
GestureDrive is a computer vision-based interface that replaces traditional hardware controllers with intuitive hand gestures. By utilizing real-time hand-tracking, the system maps physical movements to game inputs, specifically optimized for the physics-based gameplay of Hill Climb Racing.

🌟 Key Highlights
Immersive Gameplay: Eliminate the keyboard and control vehicle acceleration and braking through simple hand motions.
Precision Tracking: Leverages MediaPipe to detect 21 distinct hand landmarks for high-accuracy gesture recognition.
Seamless Integration: Uses a Python-based backend to simulate low-latency keyboard events, ensuring a responsive driving experience.
